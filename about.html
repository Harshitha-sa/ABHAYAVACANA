<h2>About Abhayavacana</h2>

<p> Abhayavacana started its operations in 2020. Currently it has 19 medical facilities across Southeast Asia: in Tripura, Odisha,bangalore,kolkatta. The company believes in setting up mid-size hospitals built in residential areas for accessibility and efficiency, and to better serve the respective communities. This also helps keep costs down for consumers with no compromise on healthcare quality, modern amenities and highly-trained teams of specialists and nurses.</p>

<p> Abhayavacana aims to be the preferred choice of healthcare services for families and businesses. With 100 to 200 beds per medical facility, two-storey buildings for smoother patient flow and new medical technologies to decrease the levels of invasive treatments, the efficiency of patient care is optimised resulting in a shorter length of stay. In turn, this results in transparency in rates with better affordability for patients. But as progressive as medical technology can be, the difference in healthcare relies much on its people – highly skilled medical consultants, caring nurses as well as teams of committed staff who see to every patient’s need, on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>Abhayavacana medical facilities provide a wide array of medical services such as General Surgery, Paediatrics, Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Orthopaedics and Internal Medicine. These are supported by a comprehensive list of ancillary services that include an Intensive Care Unit, Neonatal Care Unit, Physiotherapy, Laboratory, Pharmacy and Imaging.</p>

<p>At Columbia Asia, comprehensive medical programmes demand ethics, excellence and strict clinical governance. All of its operations follow international quality assurance guidelines that meet the highest standard of patient care possible.</p>
